This project explores the linear search algorithm by analyzing the number of comparisons made during best, average, and worst-case scenarios across different input sizes. The program simulates the search by checking how many elements are compared before the key is found or not found. It then plots a graph showing how the number of comparisons grows as the input size increases. This clearly demonstrates that in the best case only one comparison is needed, the average case takes about half the size, and the worst case requires checking the entire list
